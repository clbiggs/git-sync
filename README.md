‚≠ê `Star` this repository if you find it valuable and worth maintaining.

üëÅ `Watch` this repository to get notified about new releases, issues, etc.

## Description

This is an application with the intention of making sure that a git repository is up to date with its origin.

This is done by the following:
- Polling of the origin repository.
- Immediate Pull and reset by api endpoint.

If the local repository does not exist it will be cloned.

The repository is only updated during polling if the latest remote commit has a different hash than the last pulled, or upon
application startup.

## Build

### Terminal

- `make` - execute the build pipeline.
- `make help` - print help for the [Make targets](Makefile).

## Release

The release workflow is triggered each time a tag with `v` prefix is pushed.

_CAUTION_: Make sure to understand the consequences before you bump the major version.

## FAQ

### How can I build on Windows

Install [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/)
and copy `C:\TDM-GCC-64\bin\mingw32-make.exe`
to `C:\TDM-GCC-64\bin\make.exe`.
Alternatively, you may install [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php)
and copy `mingw32-make.exe` accordingly.

Take a look [here](https://github.com/docker-archive/toolbox/issues/673#issuecomment-355275054),
if you have problems using Docker in Git Bash.

You can also use [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
or develop inside a [Remote Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
However, take into consideration that then you are not going to use "bare-metal" Windows.

Consider using [goyek](https://github.com/goyek/goyek)
for creating cross-platform build pipelines in Go.

### How can I customize the release

Take a look at GoReleaser [docs](https://goreleaser.com/customization/)
as well as [its repo](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/)
how it is dogfooding its functionality.
You can use it to add deb/rpm/snap packages, Homebrew Tap, Scoop App Manifest etc.

If you are developing a library and you like handcrafted changelog and release notes,
you are free to remove any usage of GoReleaser.
